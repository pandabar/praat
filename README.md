# praat
Here you can find several scripts that I have used for different purposes. 
<ul>
  <li>Klaatcont: this script creates a continuum between two vowels using Klatt grids. The results are not wonderful (the resulting sounds are not very human-like) but if you add more parameters (pitch, more formants, etc) then it should sound a bit better.</li>
  <li>Concatenator: unfortunately, when it comes to concatenating sounds, Praat can be a bit annoying since the elements to be concattenated must show in the Objects window in the desired order.</li>
  <li>Continuum: the Continuum creator is the same as Klattcont but with resynthesis instead of the Klatt grid. The results are even worse, although I think you can get better results if the source comes from a vowel that is similar to the target vowel. </li>
</ul>
